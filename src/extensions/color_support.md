## üìö About

Color support is an extension for Crayon which allows you to detect color
support of users terminal, this allows Crayon to properly display colors even
for terminals that don't support all bells and whistles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

- On deno:

```ts
// Remember to replace "version" with semver version
import { crayon, prototype } from "https://deno.land/x/crayon@version/mod.ts";
import { getColorSupport } from "https://deno.land/x/crayon@version/src/extensions/color_support.ts";

// By default all options are set to false, this means that if no explicit permissions (env, run) are set it'll return no terminal color support
prototype.colorSupport = getColorSupport({
  forcePermissions: false, // Whether to force-ask permissions, when user denies permission access error is thrown
  requestPermissions: false, // When needed, ask user for "env" and "run", when user denies permission access module continues working
  revokePermissions: false, // Whether to revoke "env" and/or "run" permissions after colorSupport gets returned
});

console.log(crayon.rgb(230, 135, 100)("Hi!"));
```

- On node:

```ts
import { crayon, prototype } from "crayon.js";
import { getColorSupport } from "@crayon.js/color-support";

// By default all options are set to false, this means that if no explicit permissions (env, run) are set it'll return no terminal color support
prototype.colorSupport = getColorSupport({
  forcePermissions: false, // Whether to force-ask permissions, when user denies permission access error is thrown
  requestPermissions: false, // When needed, ask user for "env" and "run", when user denies permission access module continues working
  revokePermissions: false, // Whether to revoke "env" and/or "run" permissions after colorSupport gets returned
});

console.log(crayon.rgb(230, 135, 100)("Hi!"));
```
